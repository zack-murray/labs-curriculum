## Questions

1. Pick one team member. What is a piece of feedback you have yet to give them?
    • I feel like I need to state that its hard to give feedback, positive or negative, this early on in our project. At my last job, it was my responsibility to give yearly reviews, and I felt this was fair because after a year has elapsed I've worked with these individuals long enough that I can praise and critique them justly. We've worked for two weeks now, with 1 week being solely for planning. I believe both my DS teammates have put their best foot forward and contributed their share to the project. It's hard for me to give specific feedback when we really haven't achieved much yet and I haven't been given a fair amount of time to further assess their contribution. 
    • With that said, I'll pick Karl. I feel like he's done a very good job communicating and sharing his ideas across the team as a whole, and provides his insight when he believes it can be beneficial. I respect this a lot because open communication is naturally difficult for me and something I'm always trying to improve. 

2. What's an example of some recent feedback you received that was easy to hear? What about recent feedback that was difficult to hear? What do you think made them easy or difficult to process?
    • Easy - That I'm a great team player, that I articulate well
    • Difficult - That I could be more open with my communication, share my thoughts/feelings better 

    • It's very easy to process positive feedback, I believe we all like to see ourselves in the best light and when you're acknowledged for your hard work its easy to be receptive to what was said about you. Negative feedback, even if constructive criticism, can be difficult to process because it's hard to come to terms that you've fallen short. Especially if its an area/subject that you've tried really hard in, it's not easy to swallow that there's still areas in which you can improve.

3. What's the most memorable feedback you've ever received? What was it about the feedback that made such an impact?
    • At the end of my senior year in highschool, my english instructor gave me very positive feedback about how much my writing improved that year. This stuck with me because I was always a very poor writer, I didn't have much interest in it (I've always been more math-minded) and it was evident in my formatting and the way I wrote. That year I pushed myself to learn from my mistakes and better develop myself as a writer. It stuck with me because it was extremely difficult and at points I thought about just giving up, thinking I wasn't capable of it. But to overcome that, and be recognized for it by someone that I respect that specializes in it, that really had an impact on me moving forward. 

4. What do you think the difference is between constructive and non-constructive feedback?
    • Constructive feedback gives you specific ways to improve and its often framed in a way that highlights what you've done well and gives inspiration that they know you're not far off from where you should be. Non-constructive feedback is usually ambiguous and negative, at times even attacking the person receving it. It's hard for that person to improve if they're just told 'they suck', without giving specificity in how to improve or any positive affirmation.
