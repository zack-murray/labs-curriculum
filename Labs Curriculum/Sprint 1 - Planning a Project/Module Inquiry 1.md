# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    • Is there a log-in or save information in cookies/JWT?
    • Just cities in the US or around the world too?
    • What statistics data are you wanting to use/interested in?
    • How do you want to communicate weather info? Reviews in addition to data?
    • What's the default view? Show only specific things?

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    • As a user, I can search for a city by name
    • As a user, I can view the historical housing prices of a city
    • As a user, I can view the historical population of a city
    • As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city
    • As a user, I can view the major job industries in a city 
    • As a user, I can compare multiple cities side-by-side

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    • As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city
        • Create a wireframe for the weather display
        • Create an API endpoint to respond to city ID with weather information
        • Find an appropriate weather API to pull historical weather data
        • Determine average/high/low daily weather for each season (temp, humidity, precipitation)
        • Gather data on natural disaster chance
        • Create a visualization for summer high and winter low
        • Create icons for things like disasters and snow
        • Create temperature graphs
        • All the above features have been tested and deployed
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
        • We had really good group cohesion / communication
        • Weather is ambiguous, so we had to really brainstorm and take into consideration
          all weather related categories that would be of interest to a nomad/person frequently
          living in new places

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    • I would approach the roadmap with viewpoints in mind, who the users will be, if there are options for creators, etc. This way you take everything into consideration when planning the app. I would also make sure to brainstorm freely and openly in the beginning and going back and filling out instructions/descriptions after so that no good ideas go unnoticed and in the end will still be a good representation of our roadmap. It would be nice to breakdown individual tasks by assigning team members to tasks on the checklists, but it's unfortunately a paid feature. Instead we'll have to settle for adding teammate initials in front of checcklist tasks.
