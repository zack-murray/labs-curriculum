# Module Inquiry 4

## Questions

1. Link to the pull request you are most proud of.
    • https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs26-Citrics-DS-TeamB/pull/2

2. Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?
    Proud:
          • It took a lot of time and effort to source the data I needed.
          • Really brushed up on my data cleaning and have gained confidence in my ability to do so.

    Difficult: 
          • I had to query the census API for specific information, a task that I didn't have much experience with, in order to obtain the necessary data.
          • Couldn't find data with statistics for multiple years, so I had to gather 9 csv's for seperate years and then clean/merge them to create the dataset that I wanted.

    I feel like these two aspects, proud and difficult, go hand-in-hand because typically you're most proud when you've overcome a challenge or difficult predicament. I think if these were easy feats, I wouldn't feel as proud or accomplished.

3. How does this feature help the user?
    • We're solely focusing on cities with a population greater than 50,000. So after cleaning and analyzing the data, I was able to narrow down exactly what cities should be included in our database.
    • It will allow users to view the age/sex demographics of the city they're interested.
    • Will provide excellent time-series data to facilitate predictions for our 2nd release.

4. Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature?
    • The biggest thing I would change is creating a wrangling function and applying it to the datasets, instead of doing individual cleaning and analysis on each one. It ended up taking way more time than I had planned for and I could've achieved more through the use of a wrangling function.
    • Going along with what I just said, maybe I could've paired while working on the dataset, this gives a fresh set of eyes/input and this could have also saved me the hassle of cleaning/analyzing every csv.
