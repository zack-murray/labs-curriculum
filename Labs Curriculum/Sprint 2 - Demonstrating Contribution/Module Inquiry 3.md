# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
    • Gathering and cleaning population data 

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
    • Up until this point, I've only been the driver, so this is sort of a difficult question to answer. Personally I prefer being the driver, because as the navigator it can feel like you're stepping on the drivers toes and you don't want to incinuate that they might not know how to do something. I'm acustom to not knowing and making mistakes, so it doesn't feel bad to me when a navigator suggests ideas or directs the workflow, but I always feel bad when I'm in that position doing it to someone else. I like Samuel's input from class saying to interpret pair programming as a learning experience, i'm going to try to take that into consideration in the future while pair programming.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
    • Similar to what I wrote above, I feel like the navigator position is difficult because you're more or less a backseat-driver, and since the connotation for that is negative, I feel like that probably carries over to the navigator as well. It's tough to guide someone at the wheel when you feel like you may be interupting them or stepping on their toes so to speak. Similarly, when the driver is very competent and assertive, it can be tough to insert yourself into the situation and help break down the problem. You naturally start to take a back-seat and allow the driver to work through the problem, only speaking up when you feel like youre confident you can make a positive contribution. 
    
4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
    • I'm just going to view it in a different lens and try to view it as a learning experience. Instead of feeling like i'm stepping on toes or maybe taking the wheel too much as the driver, I want to promote open communication and go through UPER before writing any code. That way, both the driver and the navigator are on the same page, which facilitates problem solving and group (in this case duo) cohesion. This should combat a lot of the difficulties that I've laid out in the questions above.
